/**
  * A semaphore for controlling concurrent access to a limited resource.
  *
  * RxSemaphore is inspired by cats-effect Semaphore. It maintains a count of available permits.
  * `acquire` decrements the count (blocking if zero), and `release` increments it.
  *
  * Key properties:
  *   - Permits can be acquired and released in any order
  *   - `acquire` semantically blocks (suspends) if no permits are available
  *   - Safe for concurrent access from multiple threads
  *   - No thread actually blocks; waiting is cooperative
