/**
  * A synchronization primitive representing a single value that may not yet be available.
  *
  * RxDeferred is inspired by cats-effect Deferred. When created, it is empty. It can be completed
  * exactly once with a value, after which all waiting Rx streams will receive that value.
  *
  * Key properties:
  *   - Can only be completed once (subsequent completions return false)
  *   - `get` semantically blocks (suspends) until a value is available
  *   - Safe for concurrent access from multiple threads
  *   - Completion triggers all waiting callbacks
  *
  * @tparam A
  *   the type of the value
