/**
  * Handler for Server-Sent Events (SSE).
  *
  * Implement this trait to receive callbacks when SSE events are received from a server. The
  * handler provides methods for the full lifecycle of an SSE connection:
  *
  *   - `onConnect`: Called when the SSE connection is established
  *   - `onEvent`: Called for each received event
  *   - `onError`: Called when an error occurs
  *   - `onCompletion`: Called when the stream ends normally
  *
  * Example:
  * {{{
  * val handler = new ServerSentEventHandler {
  *   override def onEvent(e: ServerSentEvent): Unit = {
  *     println(s"Received event: ${e.data}")
  *   }
  * }
  *
  * client.sendSSE(request.withEventHandler(handler))
  * }}}
