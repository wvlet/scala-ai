/**
  * Annotation for marking controller methods as HTTP endpoints.
  *
  * @param method
  *   The HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)

  * Example usage:
  * {{{
  * class UserController:
  *   @Endpoint(HttpMethod.GET, "/users")
  *   def listUsers(): Seq[User] = ???
  *
  *   @Endpoint(HttpMethod.GET, "/users/:id")
  *   def getUser(id: String): User = ???
  *
  *   @Endpoint(HttpMethod.POST, "/users")
  *   def createUser(request: Request): User = ???
