# Introduction

**Wvlet Uni** — Essential Scala Utilities, refined for Scala 3 with minimal dependencies.

Wvlet Uni provides small, reusable building blocks that complement the Scala standard library. It consolidates foundational utilities from the [wvlet/airframe](https://github.com/wvlet/airframe) project into a single, cohesive library.

## What is Uni?

Uni provides:

- **Design** - Compile-time safe object wiring with lifecycle management
- **Logging** - Structured logging with source code location tracking
- **Serialization** - JSON parsing/generation and MessagePack binary format
- **HTTP Client** - Cross-platform client with retry and streaming support
- **Reactive Streams** - Rx-based operators for async data flows
- **Control Flow** - Retry logic, circuit breakers, and resource management
- **CLI Utilities** - Terminal styling, progress bars, and command launching
- **Type Introspection** - Compile-time reflection with Surface

## Design Philosophy

uni follows these principles:

1. **Minimal Dependencies** - Core functionality without heavy external dependencies
2. **Cross-Platform** - Works on JVM, Scala.js, and Scala Native
3. **Scala 3 First** - Modern Scala 3 syntax and features
4. **Composable** - Small, focused utilities that combine well
5. **Production Ready** - Battle-tested code from the Airframe ecosystem
