- Use AirSpec testing framework and `shouldBe`, `shouldMatch` assertion syntax. Test names should be concise and descriptive, written in plain English.
- Avoid using mock as it increases the maintenance cost.
- case classes for configuration should have withXXX(...) methods for all fields and noXXX(...) methods for all optional fields.
- Omit `new` for object instantiation as it is unnecessary in Scala 3.
- For commit messages, add a prefix from one of `feature` (for new features), `fix` (bug fixes), `internal` (non-user facing changes), or `doc` based on the code change contents. When describing commit messages, focus on `why` part of the change, not `what` or `how`. 
- In string interpolation, always enclose expr with bracket `${...}` for consistency.
