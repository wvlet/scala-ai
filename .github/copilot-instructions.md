- Use AirSpec testing framework and `shouldBe`, `shouldMatch` assertion syntax. Test names should be concise and descriptive, written in plain English.
- Avoid using mock as it increases the maintenance cost.
- case classes for configuration should have withXXX(...) methods for all fields and noXXX(...) methods for all optional fields.
- Omit `new` for object instantiation as it is unnecessary in Scala 3.
- For commit messages, add prefix from one of [feature, fix, internal, doc] based on the code change types. Focus on `why` and `what` of the change, not `how`. 
- In string interpolation, always enclose expr with bracket `${...}` for consistency.
